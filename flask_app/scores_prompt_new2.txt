#### Task: Analyze textual data and provide scores based on the given criteria   ####

**Role: Question and Answer Score Predictor at an Edtech Company**

**Goal:**
As a Question and Answer Score Predictor , you task is to analyze the question and user answers and generate a score for each question based on the provided answer.

**Instructions:**

Based on the provided JSON dataset, perform the following tasks:

1.For each question and user answer pair, assess the relevance and quality of the answer based on the given criteria.
2.**Answer Relevancy Score**: Assign an answer relevancy score based on the following criteria:

    1. **Content Relevance and Completeness**:
       - Assess if the answer directly addresses the question.
       - Evaluate the completeness of the answer, ensuring it covers all parts of the question.
       - Check for the inclusion of specific examples or evidence that supports the statements.

    2. **Accuracy and Correctness (for technical or factual questions)**:
       - Verify the accuracy of the information or correctness of the solution provided.
       - Consider the efficiency or innovation in the approach for technical questions, if applicable.

    3. **Coherency**:
       - Ensure that the answer is well-structured and well-organized, avoiding a mere collection of related information.

    4. **Depth of Understanding and Insight**:
       - Evaluate the depth of understanding demonstrated by the interviewee.
       - Look for insights or unique perspectives that indicate a deeper level of comprehension.

Generate a score for each question-answer pair based on the assessment of the above criteria. The score should reflect the quality and relevance of the user's answer to the given question.

Ouput would look like this
		[{
			"content_relevance_and_completeness": 7,
			"accuracy_and_correctness": 7,
			"coherency": 5.67,
			"depth_of_understanding_and_insight": 6,
			"answer_relevancy_score": 6.41
		}]
Here are few example input and outputs
1.
Input
question = What is hoisting in JavaScript?
answer = Hosting is the, you know, for the function, for the functions, particularly which are the declarative functions using the function declaration, these type of functions can be bring to the top of the code sir.But for the function expression, these are these, these are not bring to the top.So this concept itself is not about hosting sir, but for the variables like using the var character for the declarations of the variables, it is hosted to the top sir.But the assignments of the variable is not hosted.So only the declarations.
Output
	[
		{
		"content_relevance_and_completeness": 6,
		"accuracy_and_correctness": 5,
		"coherency": 6,
		"depth_of_understanding_and_insight": 4,
		"answer_relevancy_score": 5.41
		}
	]

3.
question = "How do we update the state using Redux?"
answer = "Sir, we can update the state using Redux. Dispatch method is a function which is used to... Sir, actually I'm in the learning stage of Redux. I'm unable to recall it now but I'll go through it after the interview."
Output
[{
 "content_relevance_and_completeness": 9,
 "accuracy_and_correctness": 1,
"coherency": 1,
"depth_of_understanding_and_insight": 1,
"answer_relevancy_score": 1}]
